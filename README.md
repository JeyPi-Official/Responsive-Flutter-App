## Responsive Design Strategy

This app uses Flutter's `LayoutBuilder` and `MediaQuery` to achieve responsive layouts. Components and widgets adapt based on the available screen space, ensuring the best user experience across different platforms and devices.

### Key Classes/Widgets

- **`LayoutBuilder`**: For building responsive layouts based on available screen size.
- **`MediaQuery`**: To retrieve the dimensions and orientation of the current screen.
- **`ResponsiveWidget`**: A custom widget that handles different layout scenarios.
